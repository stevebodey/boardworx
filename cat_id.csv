<div id=""showmore"" class=""more""><br />
<h2>Overview</h2>
<br />
<p>There are two basic kitesurf boards"," the twin tip and the directional surfboard shape.</p>
<br />
<p>Twin tip - is the rectangular board"," which most beginners start on; it has the advantage of letting the kite rider keep their feet locked in all the time.</p>
<br />
<p>Foot straps do give you confidence to get on the board and get going"," but they stop the rider moving around on the board"," and are always in the way when you jibe. So"," if you&rsquo;re feeling progressive try and learn without them.Top tip"," if your struggling"," just try it with the front strap to begin with.</p>
<br />
<p>Surfboard shaped boards - Push the rider into learning to swap the feet whilst turning the board. They also differ from traditional surfboards as they have reinforced decks. A normal surfboard will snap"," or heel dent badly if used as a kiteboard. This is due to the loads the rider will be putting down through the board.</p>
<br />
<p>Typically a 80Kg rider will probably need a board length of around 137-40cm.The longer and wider the board in"," it will help the board to  plane earlier"," but if you go much bigger than 151-44cm it may still plane nice and early"," but it will become quite bouncy when used in winds over 20 knots. If you go smaller then the reverse is true"," and in light winds it will be a problem getting up"," and you will want a bigger kite to keep it going.</p>
<br />
<p>Having a Kitesurf board that has flex in the core will help keep the board under control"," when the rider is pushing down against it. The board will bend"," the rocker increases"," thus helping it claw its way upwind"," and also control the top end speed with the increased rocker line across a choppy sea. If you just want to go fast and not worry about control"," look for a stiff board. <a id=""showmore-hide"" class=""hideLink"" style=""color: #fd670b;"" onclick=""showHide('showmore');return false;"" href=""#"">read less</a></p>

<h2>Choosing a Package</h2>

As a starting point"," a 9-10m kite is a good size for an 80kg man in average UK weather conditions. The larger you are"," the bigger the kite you will need but you should bear in mind that bigger kites are harder to get off the water; the smallest kites tend to be quite fast and can be difficult for novices to handle.

A good pair of wetsuit boots will keep your feet warm"," and means that when you're out on the water"," you don't have to worry about treading on a rogue shell or rock.

<h2>Stability</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although footwear for surfing is generally made from stretchy neoprene"," the same fabric as wetsuits"," most wetsuit boots also have a flexible yet sturdy sole"," giving you extra stability when you're learning something new. Boots from ATAN Mistral for example"," have soles dipped in latex"," allowing you to still enjoy the feeling of barefoot freedom"," but giving you some extra grip so you can feel confident when you are out on your board. <a href=""#"" id=""showmore-show"" class=""showLink"" onclick=""showHide('showmore');return false;"" style=""color:#fd670b;"">read more</a></p>

<h2>Split or round toe?</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Within our range of wetsuit boots"," you'll find both split toe and round toe options"," and different surfers have opinions on what they find comfortable. Round toe boots such as those made by Prolimit are often warmer for cold waters"," allowing you to enjoy the ocean no matter what the weather"," without the freezing feet. Larger brands such as O'Neill sell both options"," with split toes ideal for summer surfing"," and many surfers reporting that they give a more barefoot feel. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Best quality</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Quality is essential when it comes to footwear"," and Boardworx's selection of wetsuit boots and shoes come from well known brands such as Rhino and Xcell. If surfing and water sports are your passion"," then good quality"," sturdy boots are a great investment"," allowing you to brave the water at any temperature. <a href=""#"" id=""showmore-hide"" class=""hideLink"" onclick=""showHide('showmore');return false;"" style=""color:#fd670b;"">read less</a></p></div><br /><br />&nbsp;",,"Wetsuit Boots and Other Footwear | Boardworx",,"Click here to browse our collection of high quality wetsuit boots at low prices.
